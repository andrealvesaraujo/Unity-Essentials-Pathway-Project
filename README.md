# Unity-Essentials-Pathway-Project

This project is the culmination of my journey through the **Unity Essentials Pathway** by Unity Learn. It’s a single portfolio piece that showcases a variety of 2D and 3D game development skills I’ve mastered, from scene setup to coding and publishing. Built with Unity 2022.3.47f1, this project is published to WebGL—check it out below!

## What I’ve Accomplished
Here’s what I learned and built in this pathway:
- **Editor Basics**: Explored the Unity Editor interface and mastered 3D scene navigation (passed the Scene view flying test!).
- **Scene Design**: Created a mural in the Scene view and furnished a kid’s bedroom with 3D assets.
- **Physics & Materials**: Made a bouncy ball with a custom material and physics properties.
- **Prefabs**: Constructed a tower using prefab blocks.
- **Environment Setup**: Configured a skybox, lighting, and camera for an immersive feel.
- **Audio**: Designed an immersive soundscape for a kitchen scene.
- **Scripting in C#**:
  - Added player movement with a custom script.
  - Coded a simple rotating object.
  - Created a collectible that spawns a particle effect when picked up.
- **2D Development**: Built a 2D room with specialized 2D components and completed a 2D puzzle game featuring an animated pet.
- **Publishing**: Packaged everything into a single portfolio project and published it to WebGL.
